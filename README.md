# 30-days-of-code
Repository of my Javascript, CSS, and HTML 30 days of code

- I'll be active on Twitter and update all the projects I can. Hopefully I can get 30 projects in 30 days. 

My goals: 
- start small
- build bigger
- get my Javascript up to snuff
  - on day 2, I only have 7.3% JavaScript. I want that up much higher on day 30... let's shoot for 30%


Hopefully it works out. I know Python and have exprience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but I'm looking to do more. This is my step towards web development and web design. I actually started this process in 2001 (sophomnore year!) but gave it up because I.... don't know why :( I wish my computer science teacher (aka computer class) would've known more than she did and inspired us.


Days and Projects 
- Day 1: S-Figure 
- Day 2: Click Counter 
- Day 3: Stopwatch
- Day 4: Clock
- Day 5: Background Color Changer
