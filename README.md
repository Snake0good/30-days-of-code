# 30-days-of-code
Repository of my Javascript, CSS, and HTML 30 days of code

- I'll be active on Twitter and update all the projects I can. Hopefully I can get 30 projects in 30 days. 

My goals: 
- start small
- build bigger
- get my Javascript up to snuff


Hopefully it works out. I know Python and have exprience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but I'm looking to do more. 


Days and Projects
