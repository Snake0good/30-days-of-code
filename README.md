# 30-days-of-code
Repository of my Javascript, CSS, and HTML 30 days of code

- I'll be active on Twitter and update all the projects I can. Hopefully I can get 30 projects in 30 days. 

My goals: 
- start small
- build bigger
- get my Javascript up to snuff
  - on day 2, I only have 7.3% JavaScript. I want that up much higher on day 30... let's shoot for 30%


Hopefully it works out. I know Python and have exprience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but I'm looking to do more. This is my step towards web development and web design. I actually started this process in 2001 (sophomnore year!) but gave it up because I.... don't know why :( I wish my computer science teacher (aka computer class) would've known more than she did and inspired us.

I made some mistakes along the way and didn't post a new project every day. Bummed about that. There were a few projects that I didn't finish even though I wanted to. Just a bit too difficult. I got them started, but didn't complete. 

My plan is to go back and finish those at some time in the future. These projects included...
- calculator
- quiz app
- flashcards
- breakout game


As for the HTML, CSS and JS breakdown...
- Day 6 -> 45% CSS, 34% HTML, 21% JS
- Day 10 -> 36% CSS, 34% JS, 30% HTML
- Day 20-30 -> 38% HTML, 32% CSS, 30$ JS
